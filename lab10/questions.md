# Questions for Lab 10!

### Question 1: What happens when you swap the delimiter from commas to tabs? How does the preview change? 
(Make sure "disable live preview is not checked if you don't see a change)
The data is not sseparated by columns anymore. It is because now delimeter is setted to the tabs, not commas, but our data is separeted by commas, thus we got only one big column
### Question 2: Try sorting the scientificName facet by name and by count. What problems are there with the data?
There is lots of subjects that has one letter differece - mistakes, because of it we cannot sort the data properly
### Question 3: Use faceting to figure out the following:
#### How many different years are represented in this file?
 16
#### What year occurs the most times?
 1978
#### What year occurs the least number of times?
1993
### Question 4: What happens when you make a numerical facet of column note1, then convert the column to numbers? Is something different about the facet compared to yr?
When we are taking the facet of column none1 we will see 0 choices, but after converting values to the numbers we can see a diagram the same as for year.
I think that the main difference is that we can filter the rows with the blank values in the note1 columns.
### Question 5: Click and drag on the scatterplot facet you made to highlight a rectangle. What happens to the data points being displayed?
This way I can filter the rows in my table. I will see the only rows with the points that covered by rectangle.

### Question 6: After the last step, some columns are empty. (You can check by text faceting a column) Why? What do you think we can do to fix it?
I think this happened because some cells contain unnecessary spaces. We set our delimiter to " ", so it splits each space into its own column. We can fix this if we remove all unnecessary spaces.
